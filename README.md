# pi
I wrote this code to introduce physics majors to coding in Python. By throwing darts randomly at a square with a circular dartboard inscribed in it, you can quickly estimate the value of π:

This works because [the area of the circle is related to the area of the square by a factor of π/4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/estimating-value-pi-using-monte-carlo), so the probabilities of a random dart landing within the circle vs. outside of the circle are also related by a factor of the area of the circle is related to the area of the square by a factor of π/4.
